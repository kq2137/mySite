      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="bioText">A word cloud (tag cloud, or weighted list in visual design) is a visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata on websites, or to visualize free form text. Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color. This format is useful for quickly perceiving the most prominent terms and for locating a term alphabetically to determine its relative prominence. When used as website navigation aids, the terms are hyperlinked to items associated with the tag.<br><br>
      <h2>Choosing the Data</h2>
      <p class="bioText">Word clouds are an easy to use and inexpensive option for visualizing text data. One of the challenges of interpreting word clouds is that the display emphasizes frequency of words, not necessarily their importance.<br><br>
      <h2>Strength</h2>
      <p class="bioText">It reveals the essential. Brand names pop, key words float to the surface. <br><br>They delight and provide emotional connection. Both the creation of a word-cloud and the observation of one help to provide an overall sense of the text. The same visceral response does not happen when staring at a page of text. <br><br>They’re fast. Poring over text to develop themes from research takes time. <br><br>They’re engaging. Visual representation of data tends to have an impact and generates interest amongst the audience. For your client, it may stimulate more questions than it answers, but that’s often a good entry point to discussion. In addition, Christy Ransom recently mentioned how word clouds are a great way to show themes for engaging your community panel members. Word clouds can allow you to share back results from research in a way that doesn’t require an understanding of the technicalities.
      <h2>Drawback</h2>
      <p class="bioText">While they can help you clarify your findings, they do not actually analyze the data. You still need to organize and interpret the data yourself. This means you need to clean your text data before plugging it into a word cloud generator.<br><br>Keep in mind that word clouds emphasize frequency of words, not necessarily their importance.<br><br>They also do not provide context, so the meaning of individual words may be lost. Because of these limitations, word clouds are best suited for exploratory qualitative analysis.<br><br>The biggest problem with word clouds however, is that they are often used in situations where textual analysis is not appropriate. Word clouds make sense when analyzing word usage. They are not an effective tool for exploring complex topics such as the budget or healthcare crisis.<br><br>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p class="bioText">In the language of visual design, a tag cloud (or word cloud) is one kind of "weighted list", as commonly used on geographic maps to represent the relative size of cities in terms of relative typeface size. An early printed example of a weighted list of English keywords was the "subconscious files" in Douglas Coupland’s Microserfs (1995). A German appearance occurred in 1992.<br><br>
      The specific visual form and common use of the term "tag cloud" rose to prominence in the first decade of the 21st century as a widespread feature of early Web 2.0 websites and blogs, used primarily to visualize the frequency distribution of keyword metadata that describe website content, and as a navigation aid.<br><br>
      The first word clouds on a high-profile website were on the photo sharing site Flickr, created by Flickr co-founder and interaction designer Stewart Butterfield in 2004. That implementation was based on Jim Flanagan's Search Referral Zeitgeist, a visualization of Web site referrers. Tag clouds were also popularized around the same time by Del.icio.us and Technorati, among others.<br><br>
      Oversaturation of the tag cloud method and ambivalence about its utility as a web-navigation tool led to a noted decline of usage among these early adopters. (Flickr would later "apologize" to the web-development community in their five-word acceptance speech for the 2006 "Best Practices" Webby Award, where they simply stated "sorry about the tag clouds.")<br><br>
      A second generation of software development discovered a wider diversity of uses for tag clouds as a basic visualization method for text data. Several extensions of tag clouds have been proposed in this context. Examples include Parallel Tag Clouds, SparkClouds, and Prefix Tag Clouds. The Word Cloud Explorer, written in Adobe Flex, combines tag clouds with a number of interactive features for text analysis.<br><br>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p class="bioText"><a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a>: this tool is easy to use and creates word clouds in a variety of shapes and colours.<br><br>
      <a href="http://www.tagxedo.com/">Tagxedo</a>: this tool can be used to create word clouds direct from web pages, twitter feeds, search results and RSS feeds.<br><br>
      <a href="http://tagcrowd.com/">Tagcrowd</a>: TagCrowd allows you to create word clouds in three different ways: by pasting the text of a document into the tool; by adding the url of a webpage; or by uploading a file to the tool.<br><br>
